# Title
CoSahayak-19

# Description
With the crippling dearth of access to crucial resources during these demanding times, we as engineers are obliged to churn out innovative ideas to help streamline the process of gathering all the necessary resources required by suffering patients and families. We propose a website, namely CoSahayak-19 which hosts a database containing detailed information regarding the inventory of all the required resources. The resources that are monitored include blood, plasma, oxygen and medicines like Remdesivir and Heparin. Organizations and suppliers of the four resources can register themselves within the website and update their inventory conveniently. The registered organizations are then manually verified to account to their credibility. This portal would potentially be fully available to everyone for viewing. The general public can easily access this database with a sleek user friendly interface without having to go through the trouble of making an account. They can choose the commodity and filter the results according to the location to check the availability of the commodity. The simplicity of this service is attributed to making it as user friendly as possible.
